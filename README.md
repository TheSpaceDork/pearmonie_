##  AI Model Overview

This project includes a hybrid recommendation engine that combines AI-powered suggestions with traditional content-based filtering. The system uses a custom hook to generate tailored recommendations, excluding duplicates and ensuring content diversity. Users can filter content by post type, and a real-time analytics dashboard provides engagement insights to guide future improvements.

### Highlights
-  AI + fallback blending strategy for resilience and relevance
-  Dynamic filtering by post type
-  Intelligent async state handling
-  Built-in analytics for continuous feedback loop





##  Analytics Dashboard

- Content performance metrics: views, likes, CTR
- User engagement trends
- Built using Charts js 

---

##  DevOps & Deployment

- Dockerized backend and Frontend services
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Frontend deployed to Vercel
- Backend  deployed to Render 
- Cloud database: MongoDB Atlas
